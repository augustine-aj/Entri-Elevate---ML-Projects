# Data Preprocessing Project

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to design and implement a robust data preprocessing system that addresses common challenges such as missing values, outliers, inconsistent formatting, and noise. By performing effective data preprocessing, the project aims to enhance the quality, reliability, and usefulness of the data for machine learning.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Exploration
- **Loading the Data**: Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
- **Basic Information**: Display basic information such as the number of rows and columns, data types, and memory usage.
- **Unique Values**: List unique values in each feature and their counts.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform statistical analysis to understand the distribution of the data.
- **Renaming Columns**: Rename columns for consistency and readability.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- **Missing Values**: Identify missing values and handle them appropriately (e.g., replacing with median values).
- **Duplicate Rows**: Remove all duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.
- **Outliers**: Identify and treat outliers using the IQR method.
- **Specific Value Replacement**: Replace the value 0 in the 'age' column with NaN and handle it.
- **Null Values Treatment**: Treat null values in all columns using suitable measures (e.g., removing rows, or replacing with mean/median/mode).

### 3. Data Analysis
- **Filtering Data**: Filter the data with specific conditions (e.g., age > 40 and salary < 5000).
- **Visualization**: Plot charts to visualize the relationship between features (e.g., age vs salary).
- **Count Representation**: Count the number of people from each place and represent it visually.

### 4. Data Encoding
- **Label Encoding**: Convert categorical variables to numerical representations using label encoding.
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Convert categorical variables to numerical representations using one-hot encoding.

### 5. Feature Scaling (Score: 2)
- **Standard Scaling**: Scale features using StandardScaler to have zero mean and unit variance.
- **Min-Max Scaling**: Scale features using MinMaxScaler to have values between 0 and 1.

## Preprocessing Techniques Explained
- **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values can be filled using various strategies such as mean, median, mode, or even by using prediction models. In this project, we use median for numerical columns.
- **Removing Duplicates**: Duplicate data can cause bias in the analysis. We remove all duplicate rows to maintain data integrity.
- **Encoding Categorical Data**: Machine learning algorithms require numerical input. Categorical data is converted to numerical values using label encoding and one-hot encoding.
- **Feature Scaling**: Scaling is essential for algorithms that rely on distance calculations. We use StandardScaler for standard scaling and MinMaxScaler for scaling features to a range of 0 to 1

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive data preprocessing system that can be applied to enhance the quality and reliability of data for machine learning tasks. By addressing common data challenges, it ensures that the data is well-prepared for subsequent analysis and model development.
