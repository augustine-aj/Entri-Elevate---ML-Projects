Introduction
Real estate prices in Bangalore vary significantly across different locations and property types. This project aims to understand these variations by analyzing the price_per_sqft of properties. The analysis will involve detecting outliers, checking data normality, and investigating the correlations between different variables.

Dataset
File Name: house_price.csv
Source: Google Drive Link
Description: The dataset contains information on property prices in Bangalore, including features such as location, size, total square footage, number of bathrooms, price, and more.
Objectives
Perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Detect and remove outliers using different statistical methods.
Visualize and compare the effectiveness of different outlier removal methods using box plots.
Check the normality of the price_per_sqft column and perform data transformations if needed.
Analyze the correlations between numerical variables using a heatmap.
Use scatter plots to further investigate relationships between variables.
Project Workflow
1. Basic EDA
Objective: Understand the basic structure of the dataset, including the distribution of values in different columns.
Tasks:
Load the dataset and inspect the first few rows.
Check for missing values and data types.
Generate summary statistics for numerical columns.
Explore the distribution of price_per_sqft.
2. Outlier Detection and Removal
Objective: Identify and remove outliers in the price_per_sqft column using various methods.
Methods:
a) Mean and Standard Deviation: Calculate the mean and standard deviation, and consider values outside a certain range as outliers.
b) Percentile Method: Use percentiles (e.g., 1st and 99th) to define outliers.
c) IQR (Interquartile Range) Method: Calculate the IQR and define outliers as values beyond 1.5 * IQR from the quartiles.
d) Z-Score Method: Calculate the Z-score for each value and consider those with a high absolute Z-score as outliers.
3. Box Plot for Outlier Detection Methods
Objective: Compare the effectiveness of different outlier removal methods by visualizing the results with box plots.
Tasks:
Create box plots for price_per_sqft after applying each outlier removal method.
Analyze which method provides the best balance between removing outliers and retaining meaningful data.
4. Normality Check and Data Transformation
Objective: Check whether the price_per_sqft column follows a normal distribution and apply transformations if necessary.
Tasks:
Draw a histogram and kernel density estimate (KDE) plot for the price_per_sqft column.
Calculate skewness and kurtosis before and after transformation.
Apply transformations like logarithmic or Box-Cox if the data is highly skewed.
5. Correlation Analysis
Objective: Investigate the relationships between numerical variables in the dataset.
Tasks:
Calculate the correlation matrix for all numerical columns.
Visualize the correlation matrix using a heatmap.
6. Scatter Plot Analysis
Objective: Visualize the relationships between pairs of numerical variables using scatter plots.
Tasks:
Create scatter plots between pairs of numerical variables (e.g., total_sqft vs. price).
Analyze the patterns and correlations between different variables.
Results and Observations
Detailed results and observations will be documented here after performing the analysis.
Conclusion
Summarize the findings of the project, including the most effective outlier removal method, the normality of the data, and any significant correlations between variables.
